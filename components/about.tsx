          I love to writeâ€”about anything, really. To find a place to post my
          writing, I wanted to create a blog website, which led me to the
          wonderful world of web development. I have been gaining experience
          with full-stack development, starting off with learning React and
          integrating backend features into my projects and work. My current
          work is focused on React Native and Express.js, and I am working with
          a non-profit called Friends Life Community. I am also using Next.js in
          my projects. I am now looking for a summer 2024 internship to make an
          impact with my skills.

          In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, reading philosophy,
          watching anime, and hiking.
